JavaScript project from The Odin Project cirriculum.

# Summary:

Before writing a code I made UI in Figma to help decide about elements sizes, colors etc.
Then based on Figma project I made HTML and CSS.
Biggest part of the project was JavaScript. I decided to make one of two extra challenges from cirriculum - rainbow effect.
